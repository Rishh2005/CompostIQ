**CompostIQ** is a data-driven project aimed at optimizing composting efficiency through real-world experiments and analysis. The project explores how various factors such as the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, moisture levels, and aeration impact the quality and speed of composting. CompostIQ provides actionable insights for individuals, schools, and communities looking to manage organic waste sustainably.

---

## 📌 Objective

To identify the most effective composting conditions by conducting experiments, collecting data, and analyzing results to help users:
- Improve the quality of their compost
- Reduce decomposition time
- Minimize composting errors

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Experimental Setup**
   - Multiple compost bins with varying conditions (C/N ratio, moisture, aeration)
   - Consistent input materials (kitchen waste, dry leaves, etc.)

2. **Data Collection**
   - Regular tracking of temperature, decomposition rate, moisture levels, and odor
   - Manual observations and spreadsheet-based logging

3. **Analysis**
   - Use of Excel/Tableau to visualize data
   - Identify trends and the most efficient composting setup

4. **Outcome**
   - Best practices derived from data
   - Visual report to help users replicate optimal conditions

---

## 📊 Features

- Experimental tracking of composting variables
- Visual dashboards with key insights (using Tableau or similar tools)
- Recommendations based on actual performance data
- Scalable idea for use in urban households, schools, and community gardens

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings and Highlights

- Data visualization and dashboard design
- Project pitching and stakeholder feedback integration
- Real-world testing of sustainability ideas
- Completed AI Skills Passport (General)

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** – For data entry and initial analysis  
- **Tableau / Power BI** – For creating visual dashboards  
- **Notion / Google Docs** – For documentation and planning  
- **Manual Sensors** (optional) – For temperature and moisture tracking (if available)

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Automate data collection using IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, gas levels)
- Develop a web-based tool for real-time compost tracking
- Add multilingual guides and tutorials for wider reach
- Collaborate with schools and NGOs for educational rollout
